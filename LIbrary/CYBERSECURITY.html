        <h2>CYBER SECURITY</h2>
        <p>
            Cybersecurity refers to the practice and techniques used to protect computers, servers, mobile devices,
            electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks, unauthorized access, or damage. It
            encompasses a range of methods to safeguard digital information and assets against cyber threats like
            malware, ransomware, phishing, and hacking. This field combines technology, processes, and controls to
            ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. As our world becomes increasingly digital and
            connected, cybersecurity plays a crucial role in protecting personal, corporate, and national information
            assets from the constantly evolving landscape of cyber threats. Career opportunities in cybersecurity are
            vast, including roles like penetration tester, security analyst, incident responder, security software
            developer, cryptographer, and forensic expert. With the rise of cyber threats globally, there's a growing
            demand for cybersecurity professionals adept at mitigating risks and fortifying digital infrastructure. It
            involves not just securing information
            technology systems but also educating users about safe practices and staying ahead of potential
            vulnerabilities.
