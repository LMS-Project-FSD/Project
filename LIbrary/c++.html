        <h2>C++ PROGRAMMING</h2><br>
        <p>
            C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language renowned for its efficiency and versatility,
            commonly used in system software, game development, and embedded systems. Beginners often find its syntax
            more complex compared to Python but rewarding due to its performance benefits and close-to-the-metal
            capabilities. Entry-level career opportunities for beginners include roles such as Junior Software Engineer,
            QA Tester, or Technical Support Specialist. Intermediate C++ developers can advance to positions like
            Software Developer, Game Programmer, or Systems Engineer, specializing in areas such as graphics
            programming, networking, or real-time systems. With its widespread use in critical systems and industries,
            C++ offers a solid career path for both beginners and intermediate developers, with opportunities for
            specialization, innovation, and impact.
